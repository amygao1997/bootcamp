# SQL

## A brief primer on SQL 

.pull-left[

![](http://www.freeiconspng.com/uploads/sql-file-icon-0.png)

]

.pull-right[

- SQL is not just one thing
    - MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
    - Oracle, Big Query, Vertica

- Theory developed in 1970s (E.F. Codd)

- Ingres implemented mid-1970s

- robust, time-tested, well understood

]

---
## We'll be using PostgreSQL

.pull-left[ 

![](https://www.postgresql.org/media/img/about/press/slonik_with_black_text_and_tagline.gif)

]

.pull-right[

- Arguably the most "advanced" RDBMS

- See also: MySQL, SQLite

- Big Data SQL variants: 
    - Vertica, Google BigQuery, Apache Spark

]

## The thing about SQL is...

Since you already know

You **already** know SQL!

## Same concepts, different syntax

.pull-left[

dplyr
```{r, eval=FALSE}
table %>%
  filter(field == "value") %>%
  left_join(lkup, 
    by = c("lkup_id" = "id") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(N = sum(1)) %>%
  filter(N > 100) %>%
  arrange(desc(N)) %>%
  head(10)

```
]

.pull-right[

MySQL
```{sql, eval=FALSE}
SELECT
  year, sum(1) as N
FROM table t
LEFT JOIN lkup l
  ON t.lkup_id = l.id
WHERE field = "value"
GROUP BY year
HAVING N > 100
ORDER BY N desc
LIMIT 0, 10;
```
]

- You may have learned `dplyr` first, but...
    - SQL came first
    - and it's more widely-used

---
## Why `dplyr` vs. SQL?

.pull-left[

R + `dplyr` good at:

- fitting models

- plotting

- wrangling data of all kinds

- working with small data

- being an *interface to SQL*

]

.pull-right[

SQL good at:

- storage and retrieval

- medium-to-big data

- multi-user, asynchronous access

- serving institutional needs

- web/mobile apps

# Connecting dplyr to SQL

---
## `dplyr` + SQL connection

- `dplyr` can access a SQL database directly

- Instead of `tbl_df`, you have a `tbl_sql`

- Data is stored and processed in SQL
    - Tiny memory footprint in R

- **Lazy evaluation**
    - server-side processing
    - `dplyr` to SQL translation via `show_query()`

- See [`dbplyr` package](https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr)

---
## Example: `tbl_sql`

```{r}
db <- src_postgres(
  dbname = "imdb", host = "localhost", 
  port = 5432, user = "postgres", password = "postgres"
)
movies <- tbl(db, "movies")
class(movies)
print(object.size(movies), units = "Kb")
```

---
## `tbl_sql` works just like a `tbl_df`

```{r}
movies
```

---
## Example: `show_query()`

```{r star-wars}
movies %>%
  filter(title == 'Star Wars', kind_id == 1) %>%
  select(production_year, title) %>%
  show_query()
```

# Common questions

---
## Do we need pgAdmin?

- Short answer: No

- Long answer: I find it helpful for:
    - exploring databases with a GUI
    - fiddling around with queries
    - more informative error messages
    - built-in help
    - adding keys and indexes (more on that later)
    - then copy-and-paste working queries into R Markdown

---
## Ways to interact with PostgreSQL

1. GUI SQL client: pgAdmin

2. command line SQL client (next slide)

3. generic SQL access in R: ~~`DBI::dbGetQuery()`~~

4. `RPostgreSQL` through R Markdown chunks (see labs & hw)

5. Lots of other ways...

--

I prefer:

- (1) for SQL development

- (4) for SQL reporting

## What's the deal with table aliases?

Consider:


```{sql, eval=FALSE}
SELECT title.title, 
  company_name.name, 
  title.production_year
FROM movie_companies 
  JOIN company_name 
    ON movie_companies.company_id = company_name.id
  JOIN title 
    ON title.id = movie_companies.movie_id
WHERE company_name.name LIKE '%All Rise Films%'
  AND title.kind_id = 1
  AND movie_companies.company_type_id = 2;
```

---
## What's the deal with table aliases?

Instead:

```{sql, eval=FALSE}
SELECT t.title, 
  cn.name, 
  t.production_year
FROM movie_companies AS mc 
  JOIN company_name AS cn
    ON mc.company_id = cn.id
  JOIN title AS t
    ON t.id = mc.movie_id
WHERE cn.name LIKE '%All Rise Films%'
  AND t.kind_id = 1
  AND mc.company_type_id = 2;
```

---
## People in the IMDB

- `name`: people and their names
    - `id` column is primary key

- `person_id` column references `name.id` from:
    - `person_info`
    - `cast_info`
    - `aka_name`

---
## Movies in the IMDB

- `title`: movies and their titles
    - `id` column is primary key

- `movie_id` column references `title.id` from:
    - `cast_info`
    - `aka_title`
    - `movie_companies`
    - `movie_info`
    - `movie_info_idx`
    - `movie_keyword`
    - `movie_link`

# Keys and Indexes

## Keys and Indexes

- Keys:
    - `PRIMARY KEY`: unique, non-`NULL`, only one per table
    - `UNIQUE KEY`: unique, may include `NULL`
    - `FOREIGN KEY`: references primary key in another table

- Indexes:
    - No constraints, just about speed
    - Take up space on disk
    - Will they be used?
    
- A `PRIMARY KEY` is always indexed

## A DB without indexes is like Dory

## An index is a lookup table

.centered[![](http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/bok_0672324423/elementLinks/16fig01.gif)]

---
## So why not just build indexes on all the columns?

- Takes up space on disk

- Takes time to build

- Slows down inserts

- Not always that big of an improvement
